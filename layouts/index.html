    The Distributed Autonomous Systems and Control Laboratory (3010 Ford Robotics Building) is directed by Dimitra Panagou.</p>

  <p>The labâ€™s research focuses on advancing planning, learning, and control methods for autonomous robotic systems, with a strong emphasis on safety, resilience, and provable guarantees. We address real-world challenges in robotics, including multi-agent, networked, and sensor-based systems, operating in uncertain, dynamic, or adversarial environments. Our interests include nonlinear systems, estimation, risk-aware decision making, uncertainty quantification, and control under constraints, with applications across aerial, ground, marine, and space domains.</p>

  <p>If you are interested to join our lab, get in touch with Prof. Panagou or some of the PhD lab members. </p>
