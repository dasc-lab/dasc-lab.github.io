abstract: 'This article presents a multimode solution to the problem of defending
  a circular protected area (target) from a wide range of attacks by swarms of risk-taking
  and/or risk-averse attacking agents (attackers). The proposed multimode solution
  combines two defense strategies, namely: 1) an interception strategy for a team
  of defenders to intercept multiple risk-taking attackers while ensuring that the
  defenders do not collide with each other; 2) a herding strategy to herd a swarm
  of risk-averse attackers to a safe area. In particular, we develop mixed integer
  programs (MIPs) and geometry-inspired heuristics to distribute and assign and/or
  reassign the defenders to interception and herding tasks under different spatiotemporal
  behaviors by the attackers such as splitting into smaller swarms to evade defenders
  easily or high-speed maneuvers by some risk-taking attackers to maximize damage
  to the protected area. We provide theoretical as well as numerical comparison of
  the computational costs of these MIPs and the heuristics, and demonstrate the overall
  approach in simulations.'
