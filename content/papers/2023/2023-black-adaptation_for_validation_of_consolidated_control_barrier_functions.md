abstract: We develop a novel adaptation-based technique for safe control design in
  the presence of multiple state constraints. Specifically, we introduce an approach
  for synthesizing any number of candidate control barrier functions (CBFs), each
  encoding a different state constraint, into one consolidated CBF (C-CBF) candidate.
  We then propose a parameter adaptation law for the weights of the C-CBF's constituent
  functions such that its controllable dynamics are non-vanishing. We prove that the
  adaptation law certifies the consolidated CBF candidate as valid for a class of
  nonlinear, control-affine, multi-agent systems, which permits its use in a quadratic
  program based control law. We highlight the success of our approach in simulation
  on a multi-robot goal-reaching problem in a warehouse environment, and further demonstrate
  its efficacy via a laboratory study with an AION ground rover operating amongst
  other vehicles behaving both aggressively and conservatively.
