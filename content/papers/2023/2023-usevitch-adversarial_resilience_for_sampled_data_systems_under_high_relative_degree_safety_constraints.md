abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently become a powerful method
  for rendering desired safe sets forward invariant in single-agent and multiagent
  systems. In the multiagent case, prior literature has considered scenarios where
  all agents cooperate to ensure that the corresponding set remains invariant. However,
  these works do not consider scenarios where a subset of the agents are behaving
  adversarially with the intent to violate safety bounds. In addition, prior results
  on multiagent CBFs typically assume that control inputs are continuous and do not
  consider sampled-data dynamics. This article presents a framework for normally behaving
  agents in a multiagent system with heterogeneous control-affine, sampled-data dynamics
  to render a safe set forward invariant in the presence of adversarial agents. The
  proposed approach considers several aspects of practical control systems including
  input constraints, clock asynchrony and disturbances, and distributed calculation
  of control inputs. Our approach also considers functions describing safe sets having
  high relative degree with respect to system dynamics. The efficacy of these results
  are demonstrated through simulations.
