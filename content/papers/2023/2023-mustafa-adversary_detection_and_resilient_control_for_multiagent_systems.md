abstract: This article presents an adversary detection mechanism and a resilient control
  framework for multiagent systems under spatiotemporal constraints. Safety in multiagent
  systems is typically addressed under the assumption that all agents collaborate
  to ensure the forward invariance of a desired safe set. This work analyzes agent
  behaviors based on certain behavior metrics, and designs a proactive adversary detection
  mechanism based on the notion of the critical region for the system operation. In
  particular, the presented detection mechanism not only identifies adversarial agents,
  but also ensures all-time safety for intact agents. Then, based on the analysis
  and detection results, a resilient quadratic programming-based controller is presented
  to ensure safety and liveness constraints for intact agents. Simulation results
  validate the efficacy of the presented theoretical contributions.
