abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of future-focused control barrier functions
  (ff-CBF) aimed at improving traditionally myopic CBF based control design and study
  their efficacy in the context of an unsignaled four-way intersection crossing problem
  for collections of both communicating and non-communicating autonomous vehicles.
  Our novel ff-CBF encodes that vehicles take control actions that avoid collisions
  predicted under a zero-acceleration policy over an arbitrarily long future time
  interval. In this sense the ff-CBF defines a virtual barrier, a loosening of which
  we propose in the form of a relaxed future-focused CBF (rff-CBF) that allows a relaxation
  of the virtual ff-CBF barrier far from the physical barrier between vehicles. We
  study the performance of ff-CBF and rff-CBF based controllers on communicating vehicles
  via a series of simulated trials of the intersection scenario, and in particular
  highlight how the rff-CBF based controller empirically outperforms a benchmark controller
  from the literature by improving intersection throughput while preserving safety
  and feasibility. Finally, we demonstrate our proposed ff-CBF control law on an intersection
  scenario in the laboratory environment with a collection of 5 non-communicating
  AION ground rovers.
