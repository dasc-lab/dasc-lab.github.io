abstract: This letter presents extensions of control barrier function (CBF) and control
  Lyapunov function (CLF) theory to systems wherein all actuators cause impulsive
  changes to the state trajectory, and can only be used again after a minimum dwell
  time has elapsed. These rules define a hybrid system, wherein the controller must
  at each control cycle choose whether to remain on the current state flow or to jump
  to a new trajectory. We first derive a sufficient condition to render a specified
  set forward invariant using extensions of CBF theory. We then derive related conditions
  to ensure asymptotic stability in such systems, and apply both conditions online
  in an optimization-based control law with aperiodic impulses. We simulate both results
  on a spacecraft docking problem with multiple obstacles.
