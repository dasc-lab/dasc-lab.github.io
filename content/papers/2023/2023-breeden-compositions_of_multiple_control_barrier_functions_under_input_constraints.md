abstract: This paper presents a methodology for ensuring that the composition of multiple
  Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) always leads to feasible conditions on the control
  input, even in the presence of input constraints. In the case of a system subject
  to a single constraint function, there exist many methods to generate a CBF that
  ensures constraint satisfaction. However, when there are multiple constraint functions,
  the problem of finding and tuning one or more CBFs becomes more challenging, especially
  in the presence of input constraints. This paper addresses this challenge by providing
  tools to 1) decouple the design of multiple CBFs, so that a CBF can be designed
  for each constraint function independently of other constraints, and 2) ensure that
  the set composed from all the CBFs together is a viability domain. Thus, a quadratic
  program subject to all the CBFs simultaneously is always feasible. The utility of
  this methodology is then demonstrated in simulation for a nonlinear orientation
  control system.
