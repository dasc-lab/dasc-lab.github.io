abstract: This paper introduces a framework that guides the design of stabilizing
  feedback control laws for systems with Pfaffian constraints. A new class of N-dimensional
  vector fields, the dipole-like vector fields is proposed, inspired by the form of
  the flow lines of the electric point dipole. A general connection between the dipole-like
  field and the Pfaffian constraints of catastatic nonholonomic systems is exploited,
  to establish systematic guidelines on the design of stabilizing control laws. The
  methodology is applied to the stabilization of the unicycle and of the nonholonomic
  double integrator. Based on these guidelines, switching control laws are constructed.
  The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated through simulation results.
