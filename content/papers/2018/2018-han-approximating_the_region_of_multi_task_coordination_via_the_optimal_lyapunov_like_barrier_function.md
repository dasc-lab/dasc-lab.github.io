abstract: 'We consider the multi-task coordination problem for multi-agent systems
  under the following objectives: 1. collision avoidance; 2. connectivity maintenance;
  3. convergence to desired destinations. The paper focuses on the safety guaranteed
  region of multi-task coordination (SG-RMTC), i.e., the set of initial states from
  which all trajectories converge to the desired configuration, while at the same
  time achieve the multi-task coordination and avoid unsafe sets. In contrast to estimating
  the domain of attraction via Lyapunov functions, the main underlying idea is to
  employ the sublevel sets of Lyapunov-like barrier functions to approximate the SG-RMTC.
  Rather than using fixed Lyapunov-like barrier functions, a systematic way is proposed
  to search an optimal Lyapunov-like barrier function such that the under-estimate
  of SG-RMTC is maximized. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method.'
