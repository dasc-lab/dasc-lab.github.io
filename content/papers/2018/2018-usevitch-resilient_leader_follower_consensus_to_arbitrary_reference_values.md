abstract: The problem of consensus in the presence of misbehaving agents has increasingly
  attracted attention in the literature. Prior results have established algorithms
  and graph structures for multi-agent networks which guarantee the consensus of normally
  behaving agents in the presence of a bounded number of misbehaving agents. The final
  consensus value is guaranteed to fall within the convex hull of initial agent states.
  However, the problem of consensus tracking considers consensus to arbitrary reference
  values which may not lie within such bounds. Conditions for consensus tracking in
  the presence of misbehaving agents has not been fully studied. This paper presents
  conditions for a network of agents using the W-MSR algorithm to achieve this objective.
