abstract: This paper presents a novel method for generating the trajectory of a robot
  assisting a human in servicing a set of tasks embedded in a convex 2-D domain. This
  method makes use of Bayesian inference to predict human intent in task selection.
  Rather than following optimal trajectory towards a single task, the robot computes
  a set of potentially optimal tasks each weighted by the human's posterior probability
  and superimposes them into a cost function that is designed to minimize the weighted
  Euclidean distance relative to set. The effect is a flexible path human-robot collaborative
  network that is shown in simulation to complete all tasks in a given domain in less
  time than existing methods for a certain class of highly impulsive humans, i.e.,
  humans that tend to randomly switch tasks at times generated by a Poisson counting
  process. The algorithm is also illustrated through an experimental demonstration.
