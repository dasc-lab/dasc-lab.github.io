abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of a multiagent system achieving a
  formation in the presence of misbehaving or adversarial agents. We introduce a novel
  continuous time resilient controller to guarantee that normally behaving agents
  can converge to a formation with respect to a set of leaders. The controller employs
  a norm-based filtering mechanism, and unlike most prior algorithms, also incorporates
  input bounds. In addition, the controller is shown to guarantee convergence in finite
  time. A sufficient condition for the controller to guarantee convergence is shown
  to be a graph theoretical structure which we denote as Resilient Directed Acyclic
  Graph (RDAG). Further, we employ our filtering mechanism on a discrete time system
  which is shown to have exponential convergence. Our results are demonstrated through
  simulations.
