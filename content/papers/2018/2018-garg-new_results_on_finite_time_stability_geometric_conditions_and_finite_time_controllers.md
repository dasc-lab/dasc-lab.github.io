abstract: This paper presents novel controllers that yield finite-time stability for
  linear systems. We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for the origin
  of a scalar system to be finite-time stable. Then we present novel finite-time controllers
  based on vector fields and barrier functions to demonstrate the utility of this
  geometric condition. We also consider the general class of linear controllable systems,
  and present a continuous feedback control law to stabilize the system in finite
  time. Finally, we present simulation results for each of these cases, showing the
  efficacy of the designed control laws.
