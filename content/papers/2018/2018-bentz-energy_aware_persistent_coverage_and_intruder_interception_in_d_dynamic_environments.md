abstract: This paper considers the persistent coverage of a 2-D manifold that has
  been embedded in 3-D space. The manifold is subject to continual collisions by intruders
  that are generated with random trajectories. The trajectories of intruders are estimated
  online with an extended Kalman filter and their predicted impact points contribute
  normally distributed decay terms to the coverage map. A formal hybrid control strategy
  is presented that allows for power-constrained 3-D free-flyer agents to persistently
  monitor the domain, track and intercept intruders, and periodically deploy from
  and return to a single charging station on the manifold. Guarantees on intruder
  interception with respect to agent power lifespans are formally proven. The efficacy
  of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulation.
