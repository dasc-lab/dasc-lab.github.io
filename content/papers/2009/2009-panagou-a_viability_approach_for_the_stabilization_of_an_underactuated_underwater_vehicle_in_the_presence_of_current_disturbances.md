abstract: In this paper we present a viability-based formulation for the stabilization
  of an underactuated underwater vehicle under the influence of a known, constant
  current and state constraints. The stabilization problem is described by three problems
  in terms of viability theory. We present a solution to the first problem which addresses
  the safety of the system, i.e. guarantees that there exists a control law such that
  the vehicle always remains into the safe set of state constraints. In order to overcome
  the computational limitations due to the high dimension of the system we develop
  a two-stage approach, based on forward reachability and game theory. The control
  law is thus the safety controller when the system viability is at stake, i.e. close
  to the boundary of the safe set. The viability kernel and the control law are numerically
  computed.
