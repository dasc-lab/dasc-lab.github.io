abstract: This paper addresses the problem of risk-aware fixed-time stabilization
  of a class of uncertain, output-feedback nonlinear systems modeled via stochastic
  differential equations. First, novel classes of certificate functions, namely risk-aware
  fixed-time- and risk-aware path-integral-control Lyapunov functions, are introduced.
  Then, it is shown how the use of either for control design certifies that a system
  is both stable in probability and probabilistically fixed-time convergent (for a
  given probability) to a goal set. That is, the system trajectories probabilistically
  reach the set within a finite time, independent of the initial condition, despite
  the additional presence of measurement noise. These methods represent an improvement
  over the state-of-the-art in stochastic fixed-time stabilization, which presently
  offers bounds on the settling-time function in expectation only. The theoretical
  results are verified by an empirical study on an illustrative, stochastic, nonlinear
  system and the proposed controllers are evaluated against an existing method. Finally,
  the methods are demonstrated via a simulated fixed-wing aerial robot on a reach-avoid
  scenario to highlight their ability to certify the probability that a system safely
  reaches its goal.
