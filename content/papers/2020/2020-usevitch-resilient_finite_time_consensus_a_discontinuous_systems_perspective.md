abstract: Many algorithms have been proposed in prior literature to guarantee resilient
  multi-agent consensus in the presence of adversarial attacks or faults. The majority
  of prior work present excellent results that focus on discrete-time or discretized
  continuous-time systems. Fewer authors have explored applying similar resilient
  techniques to continuous-time systems without discretization. These prior works
  typically consider asymptotic convergence and make assumptions such as continuity
  of adversarial signals, the existence of a dwell time between switching instances
  for the system dynamics, or the existence of trusted agents that do not misbehave.
  In this paper, we expand the study of resilient continuous-time systems by removing
  many of these assumptions and using discontinuous systems theory to provide conditions
  for normally-behaving agents with nonlinear dynamics to achieve consensus in finite
  time despite the presence of adversarial agents.
