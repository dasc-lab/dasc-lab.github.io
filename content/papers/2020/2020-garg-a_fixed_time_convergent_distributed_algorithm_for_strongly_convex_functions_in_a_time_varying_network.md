abstract: This paper presents a novel distributed nonlinear protocol for minimizing
  the sum of convex objective functions in a fixed time under time-varying communication
  topology. In a distributed setting, each node in the network has access only to
  its private objective function, while exchange of local information, such as, state
  and gradient values, is permitted between the immediate neighbors. Earlier work
  in literature considers distributed optimization protocols that achieve convergence
  of the estimation error in a finite time for static communication topology, or under
  specific set of initial conditions. This study investigates first such protocol
  for achieving distributed optimization in a fixed time that is independent of the
  initial conditions, for time-varying communication topology. Numerical examples
  corroborate our theoretical analysis.
