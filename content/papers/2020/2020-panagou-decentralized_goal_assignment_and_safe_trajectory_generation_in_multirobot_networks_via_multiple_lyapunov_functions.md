abstract: This article considers the problem of decentralized goal assignment and
  trajectory generation for multirobot networks when only local communication is available
  and proposes an approach based on methods related to switched systems and set invariance.
  A family of Lyapunov-like functions is employed to encode the (local) decision making
  among candidate goal assignments, under which a group of connected agents chooses
  the assignment that results in the shortest total distance to the goals. An additional
  family of Lyapunov-like barrier functions is activated in the case when the optimal
  assignment may lead to colliding trajectories, maintaining thus system safety while
  preserving the convergence guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise
  to feedback control policies that are computationally efficient and scalable with
  the number of agents and, therefore, suitable for applications, including first-response
  deployment of robotic networks under limited information sharing. The efficacy of
  the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation results and experiments with
  six ground robots.
