abstract: This paper presents a new methodology for ensuring forward invariance of
  sublevel sets of high relative degree functions, and convergence of the state to
  these sets. We introduce the notion of the boundary layer of a set defined by multiple
  constraints, and develop polynomially-derived trajectory constraints as means to
  enforce set invariance by redirecting trajectories that enter this boundary layer.
  This strategy is then extended to achieve convergence to and invariance of goal
  sets that are specified using Signal Temporal Logic. A quadratic program computes
  control inputs online that yield trajectories that achieve high level objectives
  specified by these sets, such as obstacle avoidance and target observation. We present
  a case study utilizing this controller for a spacecraft position and attitude control
  problem requiring observation of targets on the surface of a small body.
