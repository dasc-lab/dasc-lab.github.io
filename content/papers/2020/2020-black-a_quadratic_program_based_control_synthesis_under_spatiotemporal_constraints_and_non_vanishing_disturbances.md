abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of non-vanishing disturbances on the
  stability of fixed-time stable (FxTS) systems. We present a new result on FxTS,
  which allows a positive term in the time derivative of the Lyapunov function with
  the aim to model bounded, non-vanishing disturbances in system dynamics. We characterize
  the neighborhood to which the system trajectories converge, as well as the convergence
  time. Then, we use the new FxTS result and formulate a quadratic program (QP) that
  yields control inputs which drive the trajectories of a class of nonlinear, control-affine
  systems to a goal set in the presence of control input constraints and nonvanishing,
  bounded disturbances in the system dynamics. We consider an overtaking problem on
  a highway as a case study, and discuss how to both set up the QP and decide when
  to start the overtake maneuver in the presence of sensing errors.
