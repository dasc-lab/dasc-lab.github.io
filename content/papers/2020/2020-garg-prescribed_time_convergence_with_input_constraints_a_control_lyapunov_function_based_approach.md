abstract: "In this paper, we present a control framework for a general class of control-affine\
  \ nonlinear systems under spatiotemporal and input constraints. Specifically, the\
  \ proposed control architecture addresses the problem of reaching a given final\
  \ set S in a prescribed (user-defined) time with bounded control inputs. To this\
  \ end, a time transformation technique is utilized to transform the system subject\
  \ to temporal constraints into an equivalent form without temporal constraints.\
  \ The transformation is defined so that asymptotic convergence in the transformed\
  \ time scale results into prescribed-time convergence in the original time scale.\
  \ To incorporate input constraints, we characterize a set of initial conditions\
  \ DM such that starting from this set, the closed-loop trajectories reach the set\
  \ S within the prescribed time. We further show that starting from outside the set\
  \ DM , the system trajectories reach the set DM in a finite time that depends upon\
  \ the initial conditions and the control input bounds. We use a novel parameter\
  \ \u03BC in the controller, that controls the convergence-rate of the closed-loop\
  \ trajectories and dictates the size of the set DM. Finally, we present a numerical\
  \ example to showcase the efficacy of our proposed method."
