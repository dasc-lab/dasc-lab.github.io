abstract: Many control applications require that a system be constrained to a particular
  set of states, often termed as safe set. A practical and flexible method for rendering
  safe sets forward-invariant involves computing control input using Control Barrier
  Functions and Quadratic Programming methods. Many prior results however require
  the resulting control input to be continuous, which requires strong assumptions
  or can be difficult to demonstrate theoretically. In this paper we use differential
  inclusion methods to show that simultaneously rendering multiple sets invariant
  can be accomplished using a discontinuous control input. We present an optimization
  formulation which computes such control inputs and which can be posed in multiple
  forms, including a feasibility problem, a linear program, or a quadratic program.
  In addition, we discuss conditions under which the optimization problem is feasible
  and show that any feasible solution of the considered optimization problem which
  is measurable renders the multiple safe sets forward invariant.
