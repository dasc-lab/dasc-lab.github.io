abstract: "Several algorithms in prior literature have been proposed, which guarantee\
  \ the consensus of normally behaving agents in a network that may contain adversarially\
  \ behaving agents. These algorithms guarantee that the consensus value lies within\
  \ the convex hull of initial normal agents\u2019 states, with the exact consensus\
  \ value possibly being unknown. In leader-follower consensus problems, however,\
  \ the objective is for normally behaving agents to track a reference state that\
  \ may take on values outside of this convex hull. In this paper, we present methods\
  \ for agents in time-varying graphs with discrete-time dynamics to resiliently track\
  \ a reference state propagated by a set of leaders, despite a bounded subset of\
  \ the leaders and followers behaving adversarially. Our results are demonstrated\
  \ through simulations."
