abstract: In this paper, a model reference adaptive control architecture is proposed
  for uncertain nonlinear systems to achieve prescribed performance guarantees. Specifically,
  a general nonlinear reference model system is considered that captures an ideal
  and safe system behavior. An adaptive control architecture is then proposed to suppress
  the effects of system uncertainties without any prior knowledge of their magnitude
  and rate upper bounds. More importantly, the proposed control architecture enforces
  the system state trajectories to evolve within a user-specified prescribed distance
  from the reference system trajectories, satisfying the safety constraints. This
  eliminates the ad-hoc tuning process for the adaptation rate that is conventionally
  required in model reference adaptive control to ensure safety. The efficacy of the
  proposed control architecture is also demonstrated through an illustrative numerical
  example.
