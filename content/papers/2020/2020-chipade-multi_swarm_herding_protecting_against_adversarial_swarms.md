abstract: "This paper studies a defense approach against one or more swarms of adversarial\
  \ agents. In our earlier work, we employ a closed formation (\u2018StringNet\u2019\
  ) of defending agents (defenders) around a swarm of adversarial agents (attackers)\
  \ to confine their motion within given bounds, and guide them to a safe area. The\
  \ control design relies on the assumption that the adversarial agents remain close\
  \ enough to each other, i.e., within a prescribed connectivity region. To handle\
  \ situations when the attackers no longer stay within such a connectivity region,\
  \ but rather split into smaller swarms (clusters) to maximize the chance or impact\
  \ of attack, this paper proposes an approach to learn the attacking sub-swarms and\
  \ reassign defenders towards the attackers. We use a \u2018Density-based Spatial\
  \ Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN)\u2019 algorithm to identify the\
  \ spatially distributed swarms of the attackers. Then, the defenders are assigned\
  \ to each identified swarm of attackers by solving a constrained generalized assignment\
  \ problem. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach."
