abstract: This paper presents a solution to the robust practical stabilization of
  a unicycle-like marine vehicle, under non-vanishing current-induced perturbations.
  A hysteresis-based switching control strategy is proposed, rendering the system
  globally practically stable to a set G around the origin. The control scheme consists
  of three control laws; the first one is active out of G and drives the system trajectories
  into G, based on a dipole-like vector field. The other two control laws are active
  in G and alternately regulate the position and the orientation of the vehicle. The
  system is shown to be robust, in the sense that the vehicle enters and remains into
  G even if only a maximum bound of the perturbation is known. The efficacy of the
  solution is demonstrated through simulation results.
