abstract: "This paper presents a control design methodology for n-dimensional nonholonomic\
  \ systems. The main idea is that, given a nonholonomic system subject to \u03BA\
  \ Pfaffian constraints, one can define a smooth, N-dimensional reference vector\
  \ field F, which is nonsingular everywhere except for a submanifold containing the\
  \ origin. The dimension N \u2264 n of F depends on the structure of the constraint\
  \ equations, which induces a foliation of the configuration space. This foliation,\
  \ together with the objective of having the system vector field aligned with F,\
  \ suggests a choice of Lyapunov-like functions V. The proposed approach recasts\
  \ the original nonholonomic control problem into a lower-dimensional output regulation\
  \ problem, which although nontrivial, can more easily be tackled with existing design\
  \ and analysis tools. The methodology applies to a wide class of nonholonomic systems,\
  \ and its efficacy is demonstrated through numerical simulations for the cases of\
  \ the unicycle and the n-dimensional chained systems, for n = 3, 4."
