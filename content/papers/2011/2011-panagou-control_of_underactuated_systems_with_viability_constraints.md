abstract: This paper addresses the control design for a class of nonholonomic systems
  which are subject to inequality state constraints defining a constrained (viability)
  set K. Based on concepts from viability theory, the necessary conditions for selecting
  viable controls for a nonholonomic system are given. Furthermore, a class of nonholonomic
  control solutions are redesigned by means of switching control, so that system trajectories
  are viable in K and converge to a goal set G in K. The motion control for an underactuated
  marine vehicle in a constrained configuration set K is treated as a case study.
  The set K essentially describes the limited sensing area of a vision-based sensor
  system, and viable control laws which establish convergence to a goal set G in K
  are constructed. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated through simulation
  results.
