abstract: "The Gulf Stream, which comes within 100 km
of the United States coastline in both the Florida Straits and
the vicinity of Cape Hatteras, is estimated to possess over 160
TWh/year of technical energy capacity. To better understand
the behavior of the Gulf Stream, whose flow resource varies
in both space and time, a relatively sparse network of fixed
acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and shore-mounted
high-frequency radar units have been supplemented by more
granular but infrequent boat transect runs and undersea glider
deployments. Collectively, these measurements provide highly
granular data with respect to either time or space, but not both.
This work represents part of a comprehensive effort to evaluate
use of a solar-powered autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) fleet
to supplement existing observational capabilities. The proposed
solar-powered ASV can provide data with high spatial and
temporal granularity, but comes with the challenge of optimally
planning its mission in an adaptive manner. To address this
challenge in this work, we propose a multilevel controller that
fuses the A* search algorithm with an upper level waypoint
selector and lower level heading control. Focusing on a critically
important mission domain adjacent to Cape Hatteras, and
relying on a Mid-Atlantic Bight, South Atlantic Bight Regional
Ocean Model (MAB-SAB-ROM), we compare the performance
of our proposed algorithm against several competing strategies.
We demonstrate a significant performance improvement in
terms of a dynamic coverage metric, both in comparison to
competing strategies and to the existing observational network."
