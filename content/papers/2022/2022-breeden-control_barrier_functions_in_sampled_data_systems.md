abstract: This letter presents conditions for ensuring forward invariance of safe
  sets under sampled-data system dynamics with piecewise-constant controllers and
  fixed time-steps. First, we introduce two different metrics to compare the conservativeness
  of sufficient conditions on forward invariance under piecewise-constant controllers.
  Then, we propose three approaches for guaranteeing forward invariance, two motivated
  by continuous-time barrier functions, and one motivated by discrete-time barrier
  functions. All proposed conditions are control affine, and thus can be incorporated
  into quadratic programs for control synthesis. We show that the proposed conditions
  are less conservative than those in earlier studies, and show via simulation how
  this enables the use of barrier functions that are impossible to implement with
  the desired time-step using existing methods.
