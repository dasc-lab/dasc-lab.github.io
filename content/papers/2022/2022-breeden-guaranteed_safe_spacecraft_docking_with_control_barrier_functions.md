abstract: This letter presents a strategy for control of a spacecraft docking with
  a non-maneuvering target in the presence of safety constraints and bounded disturbances.
  The presence of disturbances prevents convergence to a unique docking state, so
  in our formulation, docking is defined as occurring within a set constructed using
  prescribed tolerances. Safety is ensured via application of Robust Control Barrier
  Functions to render a designated safe set forward invariant for any allowable disturbance.
  However, this safety strategy necessarily presumes a worst-case disturbance, and
  thus restricts trajectories to a subset of the safe set when a worst-case disturbance
  is not present. The presented controller accounts for this restriction, and guarantees
  that the spacecraft both remains safe and achieves docking in finite time for any
  allowable disturbance. The controller is then validated in simulation for a spacecraft
  landing on an asteroid, and two spacecraft docking in low Earth orbit.
