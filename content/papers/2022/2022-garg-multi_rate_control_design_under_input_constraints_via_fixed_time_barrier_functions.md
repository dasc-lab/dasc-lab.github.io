abstract: In this letter, we introduce the notion of periodic safety, which requires
  that the system trajectories periodically visit a subset of a forward-invariant
  safe set, and utilize it in a multi-rate framework where a high-level planner generates
  a reference trajectory that is tracked by a low-level controller under input constraints.
  We introduce the notion of fixed-time barrier functions which is leveraged by the
  proposed low-level controller in a quadratic programming framework. Then, we design
  a model predictive control policy for high-level planning with a bound on the rate
  of change for the reference trajectory to guarantee that periodic safety is achieved.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a simulation example,
  where the proposed fixed-time stabilizing low-level controller shows successful
  satisfaction of control objectives, whereas an exponentially stabilizing low-level
  controller fails.
