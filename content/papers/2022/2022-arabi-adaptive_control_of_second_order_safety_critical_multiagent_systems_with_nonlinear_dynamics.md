abstract: In this article, we propose a distributed adaptive control architecture
  for leader-following consensus of uncertain multiagent systems with second-order
  nonlinear dynamics. A nonlinear reference model system captures an ideal behavior
  of the agents for the leader-following consensus problem. We design a modified nonlinear
  reference model system and propose a distributed model reference adaptive control
  architecture to suppress the effects of system uncertainties without a strict knowledge
  of their magnitude and rate upper bounds. Consequently, each agent evolves within
  a (possibly different) prescribed distance from the corresponding modified reference
  system trajectories. Based on an input-to-state stability analysis, it is shown
  that the trajectories of the modified reference model system can get arbitrarily
  close to the trajectories of the ideal reference model system. As a result, the
  trajectories of the agents evolve within a user-specified prescribed distance from
  their ideal system trajectories, satisfying the safety constraints. The key feature
  of the presented control architecture in this article is the elimination of the
  ad hoc tuning process for the adaptation rate that is conventionally required in
  model reference adaptive control systems to ensure safety. An illustrative numerical
  example finally demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed distributed adaptive control
  architecture.
