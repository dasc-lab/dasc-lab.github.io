abstract: "This paper presents a robust formation control problem for multiple robots\
  \ surrounding a human leader in the presence of measurement uncertainties. Utilizing\
  \ previous work on adaptive estimation and Lyapunov-like barrier functions, an architecture\
  \ is designed for the formation control of follower robots around a human leader\
  \ in the presence of uncertainties in the leader\u2019s and follower robots\u2019\
  \ state information. Convergence and safety of the follower robots is proved formally.\
  \ The proposed architecture is demonstrated in simulations and experiments."
