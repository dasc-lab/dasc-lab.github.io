abstract: "This article presents a novel method for a class of multirobot networks\
  \ to resiliently propagate vector messages from a set of leaders to all followers\
  \ within the network in the presence of faulty or adversarially behaving robots.\
  \ It is shown that the proposed method can operate under heterogeneous communication\
  \ rates between robots and perturbations of the leaders\u2019 propagated information.\
  \ As a case study, the proposed method is applied to the problem of time-varying\
  \ trajectory tracking; more specifically, time-varying reference trajectories in\
  \ the form of Bezier curves are encoded into vectors of static parameters, which,\
  \ in turn, are resiliently propagated from the leaders to the followers."
