abstract: For efficient and robust task accomplishment in multi-agent systems, an
  agent must be able to distinguish cooperative agents from non-cooperative (i.e.,
  uncooperative and adversarial) agents. In this paper, we first develop a trust metric
  based on which each agent forms its own belief of how cooperative the other agents
  are, i.e., of how much the other agents contribute to maintaining safety. With safety
  encoded as Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), the trust metric is in turn used to
  adjust the rate at which the CBFs allow the system trajectories to approach the
  boundary of the safe set. This is achieved via a novel Rate-Tunable CBF, which yields
  less conservative performance compared to an identity-agnostic implementation, where
  cooperative and non-cooperative agents are treated similarly. The proposed adaptation
  and control method is evaluated via simulations on heterogeneous multi-agent systems
  including non-cooperative agents.
