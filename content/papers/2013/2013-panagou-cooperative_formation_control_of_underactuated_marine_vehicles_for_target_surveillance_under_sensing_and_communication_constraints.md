abstract: This paper presents a Leader-Follower formation control strategy for underactuated
  marine vehicles which move under sensing and communication constraints in the presence
  of bounded persistent environmental disturbances. We assume that the vehicles do
  not communicate for exchanging information regarding on their states (pose and velocities),
  and that their sensing capabilities are restricted, due to limited range and angle-of-view.
  Sensing constraints are thus realized as a set of inequality state constraints which
  should never be violated (viability constraints). The viability constraints define
  a closed subset K of the configuration space (viability set K). The control objective
  is thus reduced into to coordinating the motion of the vehicles in a Leader-Follower
  formation, while system trajectories starting in K always remain viable in K. The
  proposed control design employs dipolar vector fields and a viability-based switching
  control scheme, which guarantees that system viability is always maintained. The
  efficacy of the proposed algorithm, as well as its relevance with surveillance of
  (stationary) targets are demonstrated through simulations.
