abstract: This paper considers the problem of navigating a differentially driven nonholonomic
  vehicle while maintaining visibility with a (stationary) target by means of Model
  Predictive Control (MPC). The approach combines the convergence properties of a
  dipolar vector field within a constrained nonlinear MPC formulation, in which visibility
  and input saturation constraints are encoded via recentered barrier functions. A
  dipolar vector field offers by construction a global feedback motion plan to a goal
  configuration, yet it does not ensure that visibility is always maintained. For
  this reason, it is suitably combined with recentered barrier functions so that convergence
  to the goal and satisfaction of visibility and input constraints are both achieved.
  The control strategy falls into the class of dual-mode MPC schemes and its efficacy
  is demonstrated through simulation results in the case of a mobile robot with unicycle
  kinematics.
