abstract: Estimating the Domain of Attraction (DA) of non-polynomial systems is a
  challenging problem. Taylor expansion is widely adopted for transforming a nonlinear
  analytic function into a polynomial function, but the performance of Taylor expansion
  is not always satisfactory. This paper provides solvable ways for estimating the
  DA via Chebyshev approximation. Firstly, for Chebyshev approximation without the
  remainder, higher order derivatives of Lyapunov functions are used for estimating
  the DA, and the largest estimate is obtained by solving a generalized eigenvalue
  problem. Moreover, for Chebyshev approximation with the remainder, an uncertain
  polynomial system is reformulated, and a condition is proposed for ensuring the
  convergence to the largest estimate with a selected Lyapunov function. Numerical
  examples demonstrate that both accuracy and efficiency are improved compared to
  Taylor approximation.
