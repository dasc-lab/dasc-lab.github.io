abstract: Formation control is a key problem in the coordination of multiple agents.
  It arises new challenges to traditional formation control strategy when the communication
  among agents is affected by uncertainties. This paper considers the robust multi-task
  formation control problem of multiple nonpoint agents whose communications are disturbed
  by uncertain parameters. The control objectives include 1. achieving the desired
  configuration; 2. avoiding collisions; 3. preserving the connectedness of uncertain
  topology. To achieve these objectives, first, a condition of Linear Matrix Inequalities
  (LMIs) is proposed for checking the connectedness of uncertain topologies. Then,
  by preserving the initial topological connectedness, a gradient-based distributed
  controller is designed via Lyapunov-like barrier functions. Two numerical examples
  illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
