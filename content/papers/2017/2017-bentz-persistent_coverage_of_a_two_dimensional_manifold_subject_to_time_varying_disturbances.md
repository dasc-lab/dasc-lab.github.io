abstract: This paper presents a persistent coverage algorithm for multiple agents
  subject to 3-D rigid body kinematics. Each agent uses a forward-facing sensing footprint,
  modeled as an anisotropic spherical sector, to cover a 2-D manifold. The manifold
  is subject to continual collisions by high speed particles. Particle trajectories
  are estimated online with an extended Kalman filter using noisy spherical coordinate
  position measurements. Predicted impact points for each particle, along with associated
  covariances, are used to generate normally distributed coverage decay. This directs
  agents to explore in the vicinity of both future and past impact points. The efficacy
  of the algorithm is demonstrated through simulation.
