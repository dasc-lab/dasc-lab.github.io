abstract: This paper presents a robust distributed coordination protocol that achieves
  generation of collision-free trajectories for multiple unicycle agents in the presence
  of stochastic uncertainties. We build upon our earlier work on semi-cooperative
  coordination and we redesign the coordination controllers so that the agents counteract
  a class of state (wind) disturbances and measurement noise. Safety and convergence
  is proved analytically, while simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the
  proposed solution.
