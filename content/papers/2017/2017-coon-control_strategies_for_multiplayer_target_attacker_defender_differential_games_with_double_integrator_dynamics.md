abstract: This paper presents a method for deriving optimal controls and assigning
  attacker-defender pairs in a target-attacker-defender differential game between
  an arbitrary numbers of attackers and defenders, all of which are modeled using
  double integrator dynamics. It is assumed that each player has perfect information
  about the states and controls of the players within a certain range of themselves,
  but they are unaware of any players outside of this range. Isochrones are created
  based on the time-optimal trajectories needed for the players to reach any point
  in the shortest possible time. The intersections of the players' isochrones are
  used to determine whether a defender can intercept an attacker before the attacker
  reaches the target. Sufficient conditions on the detection range of the defenders
  and the guaranteed capture despite perturbations of the attackers off the nominal
  trajectories are derived. Then, in simulations with multiple players, attacker-defender
  pairs are assigned so that the maximum number of attackers are intercepted in the
  shortest possible time.
