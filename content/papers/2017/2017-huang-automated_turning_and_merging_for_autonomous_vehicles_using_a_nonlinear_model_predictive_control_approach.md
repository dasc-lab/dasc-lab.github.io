abstract: Accidents at intersections are highly related to the driver's misdecision
  while performing turning and merging maneuvers. This paper proposes a merging/turning
  controller for an automated vehicle, called the ego vehicle, which avoids collisions
  with surrounding (target) vehicles. An optimization-based control problem is defined
  based on receding horizon control, that parameterizes the system trajectory with
  the control input and employs a nonlinear model on the ego vehicle dynamics. Most
  existing solutions focus on 1-D (longitudinal) motion for the vehicles. In this
  paper, the 2-D motion of the turning/merging vehicle is considered instead. The
  intersection is modeled under realistic traffic conditions, a probabilistic model
  is used to predict the trajectories of the target vehicles, and is integrated within
  a novel collision avoidance model. These models allow our controller to perform
  both line following when turning/merging, and collision avoidance, while simulations
  of several scenarios validate its performance.
