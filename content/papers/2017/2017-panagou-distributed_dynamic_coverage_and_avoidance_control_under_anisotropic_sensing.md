abstract: This paper addresses dynamic coverage in multi-agent systems along with
  certain safety and convergence guarantees. We consider anisotropic sensing for each
  agent, realized as conical sensing footprints and coverage functionals. This modeling
  results in asymmetric (directed) interactions among agents, in the sense that connected
  agents may either all be in the same mode (avoidance) or in different modes (avoidance
  and coverage). We build local and global coverage strategies which force the agents
  to collaboratively search a domain of interest, and avoidance strategies which waive
  the assumption on only pairwise interactions among agents. The proposed approach
  is suitable for surveillance applications where agents explore and gather sufficient
  information about an environment. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through
  simulation results.
