abstract: This paper addresses vision-based tracking and landing of a micro-aerial
  vehicle (MAV) on a ground vehicle (GV). The camera onboard the MAV is mounted so
  that the optical axis is aligned with the downward-facing axis of the body-fixed
  frame. A novel supervised learning vision algorithm is proposed as the method to
  detect the ground vehicle in the image frame. A feedback linearization technique
  is developed for the MAV to fly over and track the GV so that visibility with the
  tracked target is maintained with certain guarantees. The efficacy of the visual
  detection algorithm, and of the tracking and landing controller is demonstrated
  in simulations and experiments with static and mobile GV.
