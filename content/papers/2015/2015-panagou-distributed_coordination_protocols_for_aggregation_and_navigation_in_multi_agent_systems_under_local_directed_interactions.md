abstract: 'This paper proposes a velocity coordination protocol for the control of
  multiple unicycle agents, which aims to address two distinct scenarios in a unified
  manner. The former case is aggregation around a goal location, while the latter
  case is navigation to multiple goal locations. The same linear velocity protocol
  is used in both cases, but slightly different angular velocity protocols are designed
  to achieve either aggregation or navigation, respectively. The proposed angular
  velocity protocols regulate the angular velocities of the agents to reference directions
  imposed by vector fields which are different for aggregation and navigation. The
  proposed linear velocity protocol imposes directed interactions among agents in
  the following sense: an implicit prioritization among locally connected agents is
  ad-hoc decided, which results in a suitable adjustment of the linear velocities
  of the connected agents so that each one slows down with respect to (w.r.t.) the
  neighbor agent who maximizes the rate of decrease of the inter-agent distance. Simulation
  results with multiple unicycle agents achieving either aggregation or navigation
  along collision-free trajectories are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the
  proposed algorithm.'
