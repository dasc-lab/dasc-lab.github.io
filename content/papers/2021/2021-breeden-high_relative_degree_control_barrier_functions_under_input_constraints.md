abstract: This paper presents methodologies for ensuring forward invariance of sublevel
  sets of constraint functions with high-relative-degree with respect to the system
  dynamics and in the presence of input constraints. We show that such constraint
  functions can be converted into special Zeroing Control Barrier Functions (ZCBFs),
  which, by construction, generate sufficient conditions for rendering the state always
  inside a sublevel set of the constraint function in the presence of input constraints.
  We present a general form for one such ZCBF, as well as a special case applicable
  to a specific class of systems. We conclude with a comparison of system trajectories
  under the two ZCBFs developed and prior literature, and a case study for an asteroid
  observation problem using quadratic-program based controllers to enforce the ZCBF
  condition.
