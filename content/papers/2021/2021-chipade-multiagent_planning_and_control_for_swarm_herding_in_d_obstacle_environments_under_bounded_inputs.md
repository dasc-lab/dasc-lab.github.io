abstract: "This article presents a method for herding a swarm of adversarial agents\
  \ toward a safe area in a 2-D obstacle environment. The team of defending agents\
  \ (defenders) aims to block the path of a swarm of risk-averse, adversarial agents\
  \ (attackers) and guide it to a safe area while navigating in an obstacle-populated\
  \ environment. To achieve this, a closed formation (StringNet) of defenders is formed\
  \ around the adversarial swarm. A combination of open-loop, near time-optimal controllers\
  \ (that result in forming the defenders\u2019 formation), and state-feedback controllers\
  \ with finite-time convergence guarantees under bounded inputs (that guide the formation\
  \ around attackers and toward the safe area) synthesize the herding strategy. For\
  \ demonstration purpose, we consider that the attacking swarm moves under a flocking\
  \ model, which however is unknown to the defenders. Collision-free trajectory generation\
  \ for the defenders, as well as their convergence to the desired formations, is\
  \ proved formally, and simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the\
  \ proposed approach. An implementation of the proposed approach on quadrotor vehicles\
  \ simulated in the Gazebo simulator is also provided."
