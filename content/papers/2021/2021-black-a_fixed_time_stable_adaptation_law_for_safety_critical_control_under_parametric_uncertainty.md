abstract: We present a novel technique for solving the problem of safe control for
  a class of nonlinear, control-affine systems subject to parametric model uncertainty.
  Invoking Lyapunov analysis and the notion of fixed-time stability (FxTS), we introduce
  a parameter adaptation law which guarantees convergence of the estimates of unknown
  parameters in the system dynamics to their true values within a fixed-time independent
  of the initial error. We then synthesize this law with a robust, adaptive control
  barrier function (RaCBF)-based quadratic program to compute safe control inputs
  despite the considered uncertainty. To corroborate our results, we undertake a comparative
  case study on the efficacy of this result versus other recent approaches in the
  literature to safe control under uncertainty, and close by highlighting the value
  of our method in the context of an automobile overtake scenario.
