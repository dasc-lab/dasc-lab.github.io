abstract: "Continuous-time optimization is currently an active field of research in\
  \ optimization theory; prior work in this area has yielded useful insights and elegant\
  \ methods for proving stability and convergence properties of the continuous-time\
  \ optimization algorithms. This article proposes novel gradient-flow schemes that\
  \ yield convergence to the optimal point of a convex optimization problem within\
  \ a fixed time from any given initial condition for unconstrained optimization,\
  \ constrained optimization, and min\u2013max problems. It is shown that the solution\
  \ of the modified gradient-flow dynamics exists and is unique under certain regularity\
  \ conditions on the objective function, while fixed-time convergence to the optimal\
  \ point is shown via Lyapunov-based analysis. The application of the modified gradient\
  \ flow to unconstrained optimization problems is studied under the assumption of\
  \ gradient dominance, a relaxation of strong convexity. Then, a modified Newton's\
  \ method is presented that exhibits fixed-time convergence under some mild conditions\
  \ on the objective function. Building upon this method, a novel technique for solving\
  \ convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints that yields convergence\
  \ to the optimal point in fixed time is developed. Finally, the general min\u2013\
  max problem is considered, and a modified saddle-point dynamics to obtain the optimal\
  \ solution in fixed time is developed."
