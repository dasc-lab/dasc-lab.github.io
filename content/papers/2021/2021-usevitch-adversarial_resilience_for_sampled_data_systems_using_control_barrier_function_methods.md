abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently become a powerful method
  for rendering a desired safe set forward invariant in single- and multi-agent systems.
  In the multiagent case, prior literature has considered scenarios where all agents
  cooperate to ensure that the corresponding set remains invariant. However, these
  works do not consider scenarios where a subset of the agents are behaving adversarially
  with the intent to violate safety bounds. In addition, prior results on multi-agent
  CBFs assume that control inputs are continuous and do not explicitly consider sampled-data
  dynamics. This paper presents a method for normally behaving agents in a multi-agent
  system with heterogeneous control-affine sampled-data dynamics to render a safe
  set forward invariant in the presence of adversarial agents. The efficacy of these
  results are demonstrated through simulations.
