abstract: In this paper, we study finite-time stability and stabilization of switched
  systems in the presence of unstable modes. In contrast to asymptotic or exponential
  stability where the system trajectories reach the equilibrium point as time tends
  to infinity, the notion of finite-time stability requires the trajectories to reach
  the equilibrium within a finite amount of time. We show that even if the value of
  the Lyapunov function increases in between two switches, i.e., if there are unstable
  modes in the system, finite-time stability can still be guaranteed if the finite-time
  convergent mode is active for a long enough cumulative time duration. Then, we present
  a method for the synthesis of a finite-time stabilizing switching signal. As a case
  study, we design a finite-time stable, output-feedback controller for a linear switched
  system, in which only one of the modes is both controllable and observable.
