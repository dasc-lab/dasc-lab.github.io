abstract: "This paper studies a defense approach against one or more swarms of adversarial\
  \ agents. In our earlier work, we employed a closed formation (\u201CStringNet\u201D\
  ) of defending agents (defenders) around a swarm of adversarial agents (attackers)\
  \ to confine their motion within given bounds, and guide them to a safe area. The\
  \ adversarial agents were assumed to remain close enough to each other, i.e., within\
  \ a prescribed connectivity region. To handle situations when the attackers no longer\
  \ stay within such a connectivity region, but rather split into smaller swarms (clusters)\
  \ to maximize the chance or impact of attack, this paper proposes an approach to\
  \ learn the attacking sub-swarms and reassign defenders toward the attackers. We\
  \ use a \u201CDensity-based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN)\u201D\
  \ algorithm to identify the spatially distributed swarms of the attackers. Then,\
  \ the defenders are assigned to each identified swarm of attackers by solving a\
  \ constrained generalized assignment problem. We also provide conditions under which\
  \ defenders can successfully herd all the attackers. The efficacy of the approach\
  \ is demonstrated via computer simulations, as well as hardware experiments with\
  \ a fleet of quadrotors."
