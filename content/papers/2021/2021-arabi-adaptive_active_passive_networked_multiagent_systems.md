abstract: Active-passive multiagent systems consist of agents subject to inputs (active
  agents) and agents with no inputs (passive agents), where active and passive agent
  roles are considered to be interchangeable in order to capture a wide array of applications.
  A challenge in the control of active-passive multiagent systems is the presence
  of information exchange uncertainties that can yield to undesirable closed-loop
  system performance. Motivated by this standpoint, this paper proposes an adaptive
  control algorithm for this class of multiagent systems to suppress the negative
  effects of information exchange uncertainties. Specifically, by estimating these
  uncertainties, the proposed adaptive control architecture has the ability to recover
  the active-passive multiagent system performance in a distributed manner. As a result,
  the agents converge to a user-adjustable neighborhood of the average of the applied
  inputs to the active agents. The efficacy of the proposed control architecture is
  also validated from a human-robot collaboration perspective, where a human is visiting
  several task locations, and the multiagent system identifies these locations and
  move toward them as a coverage control problem.
