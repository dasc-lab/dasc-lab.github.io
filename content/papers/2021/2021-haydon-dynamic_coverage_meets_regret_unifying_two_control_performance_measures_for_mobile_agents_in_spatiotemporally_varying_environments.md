abstract: Numerous mobile robotic applications require agents to persistently explore
  and exploit spatiotemporally varying, partially observable environments. Ultimately,
  the mathematical notion of regret, which quite simply represents the instantaneous
  or time-averaged difference between the optimal reward and realized reward, serves
  as a meaningful measure of how well the agents have exploited the environment. However,
  while numerous theoretical regret bounds have been derived within the machine learning
  community, restrictions on the manner in which the environment evolves preclude
  their application to persistent missions. On the other hand, meaningful theoretical
  properties can be derived for the related concept of dynamic coverage, which serves
  as an exploration measurement but does not have an immediately intuitive connection
  with regret. In this paper, we demonstrate a clear correlation between an appropriately
  defined measure of dynamic coverage and regret, then go on to derive performance
  bounds on dynamic coverage as a function of the environmental parameters. We evaluate
  the correlation for several variants of an airborne wind energy system, for which
  the objective is to adjust the operating altitude in order to maximize power output
  in a spatiotemporally evolving wind field.
