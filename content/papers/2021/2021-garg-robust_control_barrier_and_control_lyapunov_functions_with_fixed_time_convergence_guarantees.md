abstract: This paper studies control synthesis for a general class of nonlinear, control-affine
  dynamical systems under additive disturbances and state-estimation errors. We enforce
  forward invariance of static and dynamic safe sets and convergence to a given goal
  set within a user-defined time in the presence of input constraints. We use robust
  variants of control barrier functions (CBF) and fixed-time control Lyapunov functions
  (FxT-CLF) to incorporate a class of additive disturbances in the system dynamics,
  and state-estimation errors. To solve the underlying constrained control problem,
  we formulate a quadratic program and use the proposed robust CBF-FxT-CLF conditions
  to compute the control input. We showcase the efficacy of the proposed method on
  a numerical case study involving multiple underactuated marine vehicles.
