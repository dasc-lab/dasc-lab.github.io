abstract: The centralized power generation infrastructure that defines the North American
  electric grid is slowly moving to the distributed architecture due to the explosion
  in use of renewable generation and distributed energy resources (DERs), such as
  residential solar, wind turbines and battery storage. Furthermore, variable pricing
  policies and profusion of flexible loads entail frequent and severe changes in power
  outputs required from the individual generation units, requiring fast availability
  of power allocation. To this end, a fixed-time convergent, fully distributed economic
  dispatch algorithm for scheduling optimal power generation among a set of DERs is
  proposed. The proposed algorithm incorporates both load balance and generation capacity
  constraints.
