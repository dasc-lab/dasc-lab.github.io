abstract: "This paper presents a defense approach to safeguard a protected area against\
  \ an attack by a swarm of adversarial agents in three-dimensional (3D) space. We\
  \ extend our 2D \u2018stringNet Herding\u2019 approach, in which a closed formation\
  \ of string-barriers is established around the adversarial swarm to confine their\
  \ motion and herd them to a safe area, to 3D spaces by introducing 3D-StringNet.\
  \ 3D-StringNet is a closed 3D formation of triangular netlike barriers. We provide\
  \ a systematic approach to generate three types of 3D formations that are used in\
  \ the 3D herding process and modifications to the finite-time convergent control\
  \ laws developed in our earlier work. Furthermore, for given initial positions of\
  \ the defenders, we provide conditions on the initial positions of the attackers\
  \ for which the defenders are guaranteed to gather as a specified formation at a\
  \ position on the shortest path of the attackers to the protected area before attackers\
  \ reach there. The approach is investigated in simulations."
