abstract: In this paper, we study the effect of control input constraints on the domain
  of attraction of an FxTS equilibrium point. We first present a new result on FxTS,
  where we allow a positive term in the time derivative of the Lyapunov function.
  We provide analytical expressions for the domain of attraction and the settling
  time to the equilibrium in terms of the coefficients of the positive and negative
  terms that appear in the time derivative of the Lyapunov function. We show that
  this result serves as a robustness characterization of FxTS equilibria in the presence
  of an additive, vanishing disturbances. We use the new FxTS result in formulating
  a provably feasible quadratic program (QP) that computes control inputs that drive
  the trajectories of a class of nonlinear, control-affine systems to a goal set,
  in the presence of control input constraints.
