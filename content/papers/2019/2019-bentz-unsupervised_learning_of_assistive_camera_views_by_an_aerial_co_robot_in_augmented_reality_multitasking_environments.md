abstract: "This paper presents a novel method by which an assistive aerial robot can\
  \ learn the relevant camera views within a task domain through tracking the head\
  \ motions of a human collaborator. The human\u2019s visual field is modeled as an\
  \ anisotropic spherical sensor, which decays in acuity towards the periphery, and\
  \ is integrated in time throughout the domain. This data is resampled and fed into\
  \ an expectation maximization solver in order to estimate the environment\u2019\
  s visual interest as a mixture of Gaussians. A dynamic coverage control law directs\
  \ the robot to capture camera views of the peaks of these Gaussians which is broadcast\
  \ to an augmented reality display worn by the human operator. An experimental study\
  \ is presented that assesses the influence of the assitive robot on reflex time,\
  \ head motion, and task completion time."
