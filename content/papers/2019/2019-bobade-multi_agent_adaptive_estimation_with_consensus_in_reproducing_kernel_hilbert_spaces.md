abstract: This paper presents a framework for online adaptive estimation of unknown
  or uncertain systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODEs) that characterize
  a multiagent sensor network. This paper extends recent results in [2], [36] and
  here the nonlinear ODEs are embedded in the real, vector-valued reproducing kernel
  Hilbert space (RKHS) $\mathbb{H}:=H^{N}$ with $H$ a real, scalar RKHS. Each agent
  casts its local representation of the unknown function $f$ as a member of the RKHS
  H. The result defines a distributed parameter system that governs the state estimates
  and estimates of the unknown function. The convergence of state estimates is proven
  along similar lines to that encountered in conventional adaptive estimation for
  systems of unknown nonlinear ODEs. The analysis of the parameter estimates, which
  is studied by an evolution in Euclidean space in conventional methods, now concerns
  the convergence of error functions in the RKHS. We show that the convergence of
  the function estimates to the unknown function in the RKHS is guaranteed provided
  a newly introduced persistency of excitation (PE) condition holds. This PE condition
  is defined on functions defined over a subset $\Omega$ that contains the trajectory
  of the true dynamic system. It can be viewed as an extension of the notion of partial
  persistence of excitation to the RKHS embedding framework.
