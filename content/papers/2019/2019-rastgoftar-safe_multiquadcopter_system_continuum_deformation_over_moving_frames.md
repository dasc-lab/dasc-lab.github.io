abstract: "This paper proposes a new scalable model for coordination of multiple quadcopter\
  \ systems by treating collective motion as continuum deformation over a moving frame.\
  \ The quadcopters are considered as particles in a 2-D deformable body evolving\
  \ in a 3-D motion space. The 2-D continuum reference frame (CRF) can arbitrarily\
  \ translate and rotate in a 3-D motion space for maneuverability. Furthermore, a\
  \ quadcopter team can significantly deform over the CRF presenting risk of interagent\
  \ collisions. The formulation is therefore proven in this paper to guarantee interagent\
  \ collision avoidance and quadcopter containment. Quadcopter team deformation is\
  \ guided by $N_L\\geq 3$ leader quadcopters initially placed at the vertices of\
  \ a convex polygon denoted as a leading convex polygon. The CRF is then assigned\
  \ based on independent leader quadcopters\u2019 3-D positions defined by a homogeneous\
  \ deformation, which, in turn, dictates follower motions. A local communication\
  \ protocol is defined for the followers to acquire the desired continuum deformation.\
  \ By formal characterization of the leading convex polygon deformation, both interagent\
  \ collision avoidance and quadcopter containment are guaranteed in a large-scale\
  \ continuum deformation coordination. A quadcopter team with 40 agents is simulated\
  \ to illustrate a large-scale collective descent defined by continuum deformation\
  \ coordination over a reference frame moving in the longitudinal plane."
