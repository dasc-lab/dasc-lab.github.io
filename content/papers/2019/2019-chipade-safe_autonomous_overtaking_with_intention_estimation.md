abstract: This paper investigates the problem of overtaking a lead car by an autonomous
  ego car on a two-lane road in the presence of an oncoming car. We propose an intention-aware
  overtaking controller for the ego car. The intention of the lead car is estimated
  via a combination of active model discrimination and model selection algorithms.
  Then, a safe overtaking controller is designed based on vector fields that take
  into account the estimated intent, and ensure safety of the overtaking maneuver.
  Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
