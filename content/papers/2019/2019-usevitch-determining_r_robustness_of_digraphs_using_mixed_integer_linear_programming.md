abstract: Convergence guarantees of many resilient consensus algorithms are based
  on the graph theoretic properties of rand (r, s)-robustness. These algorithms guarantee
  consensus of normally behaving agents in the presence of a bounded number of arbitrarily
  misbehaving agents if the values of the integers $r$ and $s$ are sufficiently high.
  However, determining the largest integer $r$ for which an arbitrary digraph is r-robust
  is highly nontrivial. This paper introduces a novel method for calculating this
  value using mixed integer linear programming. The method only requires knowledge
  of the graph Laplacian matrix, and can be formulated with affine objective and constraints,
  except for the integer constraint. Integer programming methods such as branch-and-bound
  can allow both lower and upper bounds on $r$ to be iteratively tightened. Simulations
  suggest the proposed method demonstrates greater efficiency than prior algorithms.
