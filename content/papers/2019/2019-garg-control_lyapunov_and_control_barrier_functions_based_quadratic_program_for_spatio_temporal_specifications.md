abstract: "This paper presents a method for control synthesis under spatio-temporal\
  \ constraints. First, we consider the problem of reaching a set S in a user-defined\
  \ or prescribed time T. We define a new class of control Lyapunov functions, called\
  \ prescribed-time control Lyapunov functions (PT CLF), and present sufficient conditions\
  \ on the existence of a controller for this problem in terms of PT CLF. Then, we\
  \ formulate a quadratic program (QP) to compute a control input that satisfies these\
  \ sufficient conditions. Next, we consider control synthesis under spatio-temporal\
  \ objectives given as: the closed- loop trajectories remain in a given set Ss at\
  \ all times; and, remain in a specific set Si during the time interval [ti,ti+1)\
  \ for i = 0,1,\u22EF, N; and, reach the set Si+1 on or before t = ti+1. We show\
  \ that such spatio-temporal specifications can be translated into temporal logic\
  \ formulas. We present sufficient conditions on the existence of a control input\
  \ in terms of PT CLF and control barrier functions. Then, we present a QP to compute\
  \ the control input efficiently, and show its feasibility under the assumptions\
  \ of existence of a PT CLF. To the best of authors\u2019 knowledge, this is the\
  \ first paper proposing a QP based method for the aforementioned problem of satisfying\
  \ spatiotemporal specifications for nonlinear control-affine dynamics with input\
  \ constraints. We also discuss the limitations of the proposed methods and directions\
  \ of future work to overcome these limitations. We present numerical examples to\
  \ corroborate our proposed methods."
