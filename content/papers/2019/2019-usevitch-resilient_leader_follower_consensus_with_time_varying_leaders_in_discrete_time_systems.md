abstract: "The problem of consensus in the presence of adversarially behaving agents\
  \ has been studied extensively in the literature. The proposed algorithms typically\
  \ guarantee that the consensus value lies within the convex hull of the initial\
  \ states of the normally-behaving agents. In leader-follower consensus problems\
  \ however, the objective for normally behaving agents is to track a time-varying\
  \ reference state that may take on values outside of this convex hull. In this paper\
  \ we present a method for agents with discrete-time dynamics to resiliently track\
  \ a set of leaders\u2019 common time-varying reference state despite a bounded subset\
  \ of the leaders and followers behaving adversarially. The efficacy of our results\
  \ are demonstrated through simulations."
