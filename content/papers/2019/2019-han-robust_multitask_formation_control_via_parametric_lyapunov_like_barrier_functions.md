abstract: An essential problem in the coordination of multiple agents is formation
  control. Significant challenges to the theoretical design may arise when the multiagent
  system is subject to uncertainty. This paper considers the robust multitask formation
  control problem for multiple agents, whose communication and measurements are disturbed
  by uncertain parameters. The control objectives include achieving the desired configuration,
  avoiding collisions, and preserving the connectivity of the uncertain topology.
  To achieve these objectives, we first provide conditions in terms of linear matrix
  inequalities for checking the connectivity of uncertain topologies. Then, we propose
  a new type of Lyapunov-like barrier function, called parametric Lyapunov-like barrier
  function, that is applicable to multiagent systems with uncertainties in communication
  and measurements. It is shown that this new type of Lyapunov-like barrier function
  guarantees the robust multitask formation and displays advantages over parameter-independent
  Lyapunov-like barrier functions. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated
  via simulation results.
