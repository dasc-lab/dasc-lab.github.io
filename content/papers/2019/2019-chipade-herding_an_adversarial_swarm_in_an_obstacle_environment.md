abstract: "This paper studies a defense approach against a swarm of adversarial agents.\
  \ We employ a closed formation (\u2018StringNet\u2019) of defending agents around\
  \ the adversarial agents to restrict their motion and guide them to a safe area\
  \ while navigating in an obstacle-populated environment. Control laws for forming\
  \ the StringNet and guiding it to a safe area are developed, and the stability of\
  \ the closed-loop system is analyzed formally. The adversarial swarm is assumed\
  \ to move as a flock in the presence of rectangular obstacles. Simulation results\
  \ are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach."
