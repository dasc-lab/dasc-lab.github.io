abstract: This paper investigates a problem of defending safety-critical infrastructure
  from an adversarial aerial attacker in an urban environment. A circular arc formation
  of defenders is formed around the attacker, and vector-field based guidance laws
  herd the attacker to a predefined safe area in the presence of rectangular obstacles.
  The defenders' formation is defined based on a novel vector field that imposes super-elliptic
  contours around the obstacles, to closely resemble their rectangular shape. A novel
  finite-time stabilizing controller is proposed to guide the defenders to their desired
  formation, while avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions. The efficacy of
  the approach is demonstrated via simulation results.
