abstract: This paper presents a predictive vector-field based controller for the motion
  of an ego-vehicle through highway traffic. The design is composed of a vector field
  controller in closed form, whose control gains are optimized online. Upon certain
  assumptions on the traffic conditions, safe solutions can be derived. Simulation
  results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to a standard
  NMPC approach.
