abstract: Vision-based formation control of multiple agents, such as mobile robots
  or fully autonomous cars, has recently received great interest due to its application
  in robotic networks and automated highways. This paper addresses the cooperative
  motion coordination of leader-follower formations of nonholonomic mobile robots,
  under visibility and communication constraints in known polygonal obstacle environments.
  We initially consider the case of N = 2 agents moving in L-F fashion and propose
  a feedback control strategy under which L ensures obstacle avoidance for both robots,
  while F ensures visibility maintenance with L and intervehicle collision avoidance.
  The derived algorithms are based on set-theoretic methods to guarantee visibility
  maintenance, dipolar vector fields to maintain the formation shape, and the consideration
  of the formation as a tractor-trailer system to ensure obstacle avoidance. We furthermore
  show how the coordination and control design extends to the case of N > 2 agents,
  and provide simulation results, which demonstrate the efficacy of the control solutions.
  The proposed algorithms do not require information exchange among robots, but are
  instead based on information locally available to each agent. In this way, the desired
  tasks are executed and achieved in a decentralized manner, with each robot taking
  care of converging to a desired configuration, while maintaining visibility with
  its target.
