abstract: This paper considers the problem of decentralized goal assignment and trajectory
  generation for multi-robot networks when only local communication is available,
  and proposes an approach based on methods related to switched systems and set invariance.
  A family of Lyapunov-like functions is employed to encode the (local) decision making
  among candidate goal assignments, under which the agents pick the assignment which
  results in the shortest total distance to the goals. An additional family of Lyapunov-like
  barrier functions is activated in the case when the optimal assignment may lead
  to colliding trajectories, thus maintaining system safety while preserving the convergence
  guarantees. The proposed switching strategies give rise to feedback control policies
  which are scalable as the number of agents increases, and therefore are suitable
  for applications including first-response deployment of robotic networks under limited
  information sharing. Simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
