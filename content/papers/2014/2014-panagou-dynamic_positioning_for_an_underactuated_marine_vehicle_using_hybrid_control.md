abstract: The increasing interest in autonomous marine systems and related applications
  has motivated, among others, the development of systems and algorithms for the dynamic
  positioning of underactuated marine vehicles (ships, surface vessels and underwater
  vehicles) under the influence of unknown environmental disturbances. In this paper,
  we present a state feedback control solution for the navigation and practical stabilisation
  of an underactuated marine vehicle under non-vanishing current disturbances, by
  means of hybrid control. The proposed solution involves a logic-based switching
  control strategy among simple state feedback controllers, which renders the position
  trajectories of the vehicle practically stable to a goal set around a desired position.
  The control scheme consists of three control laws; the first one is active out of
  the goal set and drives the system trajectories into this set, based on a novel
  dipolar vector field. The other two control laws are active in the goal set and
  alternately regulate the position and the orientation of the vehicle, so that the
  switched system is practically stable around the desired position. The overall system
  is shown to be robust, in the sense that the vehicle enters and remains into the
  goal set even if the external current disturbance is unknown, varying and only its
  maximum bound (magnitude) is given. The efficacy of the proposed solution is demonstrated
  through simulation results.
