abstract: "This paper presents a novel method on the motion and path planning for\
  \ unicycle robots in environments with static circular obstacles. The method employs\
  \ a family of 2-dimensional analytic vector fields, which have singular points of\
  \ high-order type and whose integral curves exhibit various patterns depending on\
  \ the value of a parameter \u03BB. More specifically, for a known value of \u03BB\
  \ the vector field has a unique singular point of dipole type and its integral curves\
  \ are suitable for steering the unicycle to a goal configuration. Furthermore, for\
  \ the value of \u03BB that the vector field has a continuum of singular points,\
  \ the integral curves can be used to define flows around circular obstacles. An\
  \ almost global feedback motion plan is then constructed by suitably blending attractive\
  \ and repulsive vector fields in a static obstacle environment. The proposed motion\
  \ planning and control design is also extended to the multi-agent case, where each\
  \ agent needs to converge to a desired configuration while avoiding collisions with\
  \ other agents. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated via simulation results."
