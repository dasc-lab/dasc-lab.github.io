abstract: This paper considers dynamic coverage control for nonholonomic agents along
  with collision avoidance guarantees. The novelties of the approach rely on the consideration
  of anisotropic sensing, which is realized via conic sensing footprints and sensing
  (coverage) functions for each agent, and on a novel form of avoidance functions.
  The considered sensing functions encode field-of-view and range constraints, and
  also the degradation of effective sensing close to the boundaries of the sensing
  footprint. Thus the proposed approach is suitable for surveillance applications
  where each agent is assigned with the task to gather enough information, such as
  video streaming in an obstacle environment. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated
  through simulation results.
