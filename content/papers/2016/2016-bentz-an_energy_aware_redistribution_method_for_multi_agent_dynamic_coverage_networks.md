abstract: This paper considers dynamic coverage control of unicycle multi-agent systems
  under power constraints. The agents under consideration implement a visually based
  patrol protocol. They observe their environment via forward-facing conical anisotropic
  sensing regions. A local coverage control strategy is presented that allows for
  the cooperative search of a domain while maintaining collision avoidance guarantees
  using a novel control method based on the coverage level. Additionally, a novel
  energy-aware global coverage technique is introduced that restricts the operating
  range of power-constrained agents while shifting the network redistribution effort
  onto less constrained agents. The results of several scenarios are presented in
  simulation to illustrate the efficacy of these algorithms.
