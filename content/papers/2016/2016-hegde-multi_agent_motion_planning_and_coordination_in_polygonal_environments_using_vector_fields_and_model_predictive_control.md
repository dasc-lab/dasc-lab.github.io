abstract: "In this paper, we extend earlier work on motion planning and coordination\
  \ of multiple agents, to environments of arbitrary polygonal obstacles, using non-gradient\
  \ vector fields to steer each agent towards their goal configurations while avoiding\
  \ collisions. We formulate the vector fields so that the pattern of their integral\
  \ curves depends on a parameter \u03BB. By manipulating the value of \u03BB, we\
  \ obtain a set of vector fields whose integral curves define the flow lines for\
  \ an a priori known obstacle environment. We use the vector field design in tandem\
  \ with model predictive control to compute safe trajectories for multi-agent systems.\
  \ The competence of the proposed methodology is demonstrated for both static and\
  \ dynamic environment via simulation results. The efficacy of model predictive control\
  \ in achieving control trajectories, free of chattering, for multi-agent coordination\
  \ is validated through comparison to a state feedback coordination and control protocol."
