abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-agent coordination and control
  under multiple objectives, and presents a set-theoretic formulation amenable to
  Lyapunov-based analysis and control design. A novel class of Lyapunov-like barrier
  functions is introduced and used to encode multiple, non-trivial control objectives,
  such as collision avoidance, proximity maintenance and convergence to desired destinations.
  The construction is based on recentered barrier functions and on maximum approximation
  functions. Thus, a single Lyapunov-like function is used to encode the constrained
  set of each agent, yielding simple, gradient-based control solutions. The derived
  control strategies are distributed, i.e., based on information locally available
  to each agent, which is dictated by sensing and communication limitations. Furthermore,
  the proposed coordination protocol dictates semi-cooperative conflict resolution
  among agents, which can be also thought as prioritization, as well as conflict resolution
  with respect to an agent (the leader) which is not actively participating in collision
  avoidance, except when necessary. The considered scenario is pertinent to surveillance
  tasks and involves nonholonomic vehicles. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated
  through simulation results.
