abstract: This paper addresses the problem of controlling a leader-follower (L - F)
  formation of two unicycle mobile robots moving under visibility constraints in a
  known obstacle environment. Visibility constraints are realized as inequality state
  constraints that determine a visibility set K. Maintaining visibility is translated
  into controlling the robots so that system trajectories starting in K always remain
  in K. We provide the conditions under which visibility is maintained, as well as
  a feedback control scheme that forces F to converge and remain into a set of desired
  configurations w.r.t. L while maintaining visibility. We also propose a cooperative
  control scheme for the motion of the formation in a known obstacle environment,
  so that both collision avoidance and maintaining visibility are ensured. The proposed
  control schemes are decentralized, in the sense that there is no direct communication
  between the robots. The efficacy of our algorithms is evaluated through simulations.
